# Functions and Errors

This Solidity program is a simple program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality as well as the use of modifiers, functions and conditional statements of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how it works.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has three public variables that stores the owner, num, and value, one modifier which checks that when used only the owner can access the functions, then we have 3 functions which showcase the use of the inbuilt functions require(), assert() and revert(). This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste the code from the text.sol file into the file you created.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile text.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "EContract" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with the functions by giving the required arguments.
